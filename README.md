# Demoblaze_Manual_Testing_Project
In this project, I tested an e-commerce website named demoblaze which is a store for selling products like mobile phones, laptops and monitors.
I focused on testing the login and signup features and ordering functionality and more...
I wrote 16 test cases that covered multiple parts of the website.
I found 10 bugs and reported them in a detailed report.
I used functional and UI testing.
